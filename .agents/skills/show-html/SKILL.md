# Show HTML

Generate self-contained HTML pages for rich agent output. Zero dependencies, fully inline CSS, viewable in any browser.

## Execution contract (mandatory)

The calling agent is the orchestrator. The orchestrator must never write the HTML or site implementation itself. It owns all user communication, required product and design decisions, the delegation brief, diff review, and final verification.

Before delegation, the orchestrator must collect:

- The user's goal
- The actual content and data
- The exact target paths and allowed file scope
- Existing project conventions
- The relevant reference asset or assets from this skill
- All constraints
- Acceptance and verification requirements

The orchestrator must resolve each required decision before delegation. It must not ask Sol to resolve an unclear product or design choice. It must pass one complete, concrete brief and all relevant file paths, file content, and project context to exactly one GPT-5.6 Sol implementation subagent through the Codex CLI. Use this exact command form and send the brief on standard input:

```sh
codex exec -m gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort=high --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check -
```

Use this handoff template:

```text
Goal: <the complete user outcome>
Files/scope: <exact write targets, allowed reads, and forbidden paths>
Content/data: <all real copy, values, records, and source material>
Reference asset: <selected asset path(s) and the patterns to reuse>
Constraints: <project conventions, technical limits, and resolved decisions>
Acceptance: <observable completion criteria; require a complete, self-contained working HTML page, never a partial snippet>
Verify: <focused checks Sol may run and evidence it must return>
```

Sol is an executor and implementor only. Sol may inspect allowed files, implement the delegated site or HTML work within the specified scope, and run the requested focused checks. Sol must not invent requirements, make unresolved product or design decisions, ask the user questions, orchestrate other agents, or edit unrelated files.

After Sol returns, the orchestrator must review Sol's diff and verify the completed surface before it reports to the user. The orchestrator, not Sol, owns user communication and final verification.

## When to Generate HTML

Prefer HTML over markdown when the output needs:
- Multi-column layouts or side-by-side comparison
- Interactive elements (filters, toggles, drag-drop)
- Color-coded status indicators or severity badges
- Charts, diagrams, or flowcharts
- Slide-style presentations
- Code review with inline annotations
- Any content exceeding ~500 words that benefits from visual hierarchy

## Design System

All examples share a consistent design language. Use these patterns.

### Color Palette (CSS Custom Properties)

```css
:root {
  --ivory: #FAF9F5;
  --slate: #141413;
  --clay:  #D97757;
  --oat:   #E3DACC;
  --olive: #788C5D;
  --rust:  #B04A3F;
  --white: #FFFFFF;
  --gray-100: #F0EEE6;
  --gray-300: #D1CFC5;
  --gray-500: #87867F;
  --gray-700: #3D3D3A;
}
```

- Background: `--ivory`. Cards/panels: `--white` with `--gray-300` borders.
- Accent: `--clay` for primary actions, links, highlights.
- Success: `--olive`. Error/danger: `--rust`. Muted: `--gray-500`.

### Typography

```css
--serif: ui-serif, Georgia, "Times New Roman", serif;   /* headings */
--sans:  system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif; /* body */
--mono:  ui-monospace, "SF Mono", Menlo, Consolas, monospace; /* code, labels */
```

- h1: `--serif`, 30-40px, `font-weight: 500`
- Body: `--sans`, 14-15px, `line-height: 1.5-1.6`
- Eyebrow labels: `--mono`, 11-12px, uppercase, `letter-spacing: 0.08em`, `--gray-500`

### Layout

- Page wrapper: `max-width: 860-1120px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 48-56px 24-32px`
- Card pattern: `border: 1.5px solid var(--gray-300); border-radius: 8-12px; padding: 24-32px; background: var(--white)`
- Grid for multi-column: `display: grid; gap: 16-24px`

### Page Structure

Every page follows: **header** (eyebrow + h1 + subtitle) → **content sections** → (optional) **interactive controls**

```html
<div class="page">
  <header>
    <p class="eyebrow">Category / Context</p>
    <h1>Page Title</h1>
    <p class="sub">Brief description</p>
  </header>
  <!-- content -->
</div>
```

## Generation Workflow

1. **Identify the scenario** — match user request to a use case category above
2. **Read the reference file** — read the matching `assets/XX-*.html` for layout and pattern details
3. **Adapt to real data** — replace sample data with user's actual content; preserve the design patterns
4. **Output a single `.html` file** — fully self-contained, inline CSS, no external dependencies

### Key Rules

- Always include `<!DOCTYPE html>` and proper `<meta charset>` / viewport tags
- All CSS must be inline in a single `<style>` block
- No external dependencies (no CDN links, no frameworks, no build step)
- Use semantic HTML where possible
- Ensure basic responsiveness (test mentally at 768px and 1200px widths)
- Generate complete, working pages — never partial snippets
- When no specific use case matches, combine patterns from the closest examples
