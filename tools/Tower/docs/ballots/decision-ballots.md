# Decision ballots — open owner queue

Every open decision, and **nothing else**. The instant a decision is submitted it
leaves this file: it is recorded in the decision log in
[`syntax-decisions.md`](syntax-decisions.md) and removed here. No "recently
ratified" section, no decided history — decided decisions never reappear.

**House rule for whoever edits this file (enforced — a card missing any of these is
not ballot-ready; Tower v2 Focus Mode renders these as labeled facets, so use the
exact bold labels):** every full decision card carries `**Gist:**` (one VERY short
plain sentence — the headline), `**Story.**` (a real person with an
American-traditional name and what they're doing), `**In the wild:**` (a fenced
```jet block of realistic project code where this bites), `**Other languages:**`
(short fenced blocks for Rust/TS/Swift/etc. when a cross-language compare helps),
`**Tradeoffs:**` (a compact table, one row per option, columns that actually differ —
subagent-reviewed), and a **worked example of every option** (each
`- **Option X — <name>.**` bullet with its own fenced ```jet/```shell block; mark the
recommended one `(recommended)`). Close with `**Recommendation:**` + a one-line why.
Put Owner Q&A in `**Owner Q …**` blocks — Tower routes those to a separate Q&A facet,
so keep them out of the recommendation. Decisions not yet drafted to that bar are
listed below as one-liners with a recommendation; expand one into a full card when
it's time to decide it.

## Open decisions

_One card open for the owner: **D-ROLLBACK-TRAIT** — the `Rollback` trait method shape (deferred from D-TXN-ROLLBACK layer 2). Card below. (The earlier batch is recorded in syntax-decisions.md.)_

---

### D-ROLLBACK-TRAIT — the `Rollback` trait's method shape (layer 2)

**Gist:** What methods does a type write/derive to customize how a `#Transact` block snapshots and restores it, instead of the default deep clone?

**Story.** Dana maintains a 200k-row in-memory ledger inside a `#Transact` block. The default auto-snapshot (D-TXN-ROLLBACK layer 1) deep-clones the whole table on entry — correct, but it doubles her memory and stalls the hot path. She wants to say "snapshot me cheaply: just record the row indices I'm about to touch, and on rollback put those rows back" — a diff, not a copy. Layer 2 is the seam for that: a `Rollback` trait her type implements (or derives) that the block calls instead of the generic clone.

**In the wild:**
```jet
// Dana's ledger wants a cheap diff-snapshot instead of a full clone.
struct Ledger { rows: [Row] }

// ...some Rollback impl here — SHAPE IS THE QUESTION...

fn post(ledger: ~Ledger, batch: [Entry]) -> Int ? PostError {
    #Transact(tx) {
        ledger.apply(batch)          // mutates ledger; the block uses Ledger's
        if !ledger.balanced() {      // Rollback impl (a diff) instead of a deep clone
            return err(PostError.Unbalanced)
        }
    }
    return ok(batch.len())
}
```

**Other languages:**
```rust
// Rust has no transaction trait; people hand-roll a guard that stores an undo closure,
// or a `Clone` snapshot. Diff-based undo is always bespoke.
```
```text
// Databases: a write-ahead log / undo log records *deltas*; rollback replays them in
// reverse. That is conceptually layer-2-as-diff. STM (Haskell/Clojure) snapshots the
// whole TVar set and discards on retry — layer-1-as-clone. Jet wants both available.
```

**What is already shipped (not in question):** layer 1 (auto deep-clone snapshot of every mutated in-scope root) and layer 3 (`tx.on_rollback(() => {…})`, the by-hand undo) are fully built and runnable in `examples/features/110_transact.jet`. The `Rollback` trait NAME is reserved (`Source/Syntax.rs::TRAIT_ROLLBACK`). Only the trait's method shape + derive semantics are open.

**Tradeoffs:**

| Option | Snapshot type | Restore call | Derive does | Cost when unused | Footgun |
|--------|--------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|---------|
| A — paired `snapshot`/`restore`, assoc. snapshot type | author-chosen `Snapshot` | `restore(self, snap)` | field-wise clone snapshot | none (only on `impl`/`derive`) | author must keep snap consistent with self |
| B — single `rollback(mut self, snapshot)` + `snapshot(self) -> Self` | `Self` (a clone) | `rollback(self, prev)` | clone + assign | none | snapshot is whole-self → no cheaper than layer 1 |
| C — undo-log: `record(self, tx)` registers deltas | n/a (deltas live in tx) | n/a (tx replays) | nothing useful | none | most powerful, most rope |

**Worked example of every option:**

- **Option A — paired methods with an associated snapshot type (recommended).** The type names its own (possibly small) snapshot representation.
```jet
trait Rollback {
    type Snapshot
    fn snapshot(self) -> Snapshot          // capture pre-state (may be a cheap diff)
    fn restore(self: ~Self, snap: Snapshot) // put it back on rollback
}
impl Rollback for Ledger {
    type Snapshot = [Int]                  // just the touched row indices
    fn snapshot(self) -> [Int] { return self.dirty_indices() }
    fn restore(self: ~Ledger, snap: [Int]) { self.revert_rows(snap) }
}
// The block calls ledger.snapshot() on entry, ledger.restore(snap) on `?`-failure.
```

- **Option B — single combined shape, snapshot is always `Self`.** Simplest, but the snapshot is a whole-self clone, so it gives layer 1's cost back; only the *restore* is customizable.
```jet
trait Rollback {
    fn snapshot(self) -> Self
    fn rollback(self: ~Self, prev: Self)
}
impl Rollback for Counter {
    fn snapshot(self) -> Counter { return self }     // clone
    fn rollback(self: ~Counter, prev: Counter) { self.n = prev.n }
}
```

- **Option C — undo-log: the type registers deltas on the transaction handle.** Maximum power (true WAL), maximum rope; needs the `tx` handle threaded into the trait method.
```jet
trait Rollback {
    fn record(self, tx: ~Transaction)   // push reverse-deltas onto tx's undo stack
}
impl Rollback for Ledger {
    fn record(self, tx: ~Transaction) {
        for i in self.dirty_indices() {
            old @= self.rows[i].clone()
            tx.on_rollback(() => { self.rows[i] = old })   // reuse layer 3
        }
    }
}
```

**Recommendation:** Option A — an associated `Snapshot` type with paired `snapshot`/`restore` is the only one that delivers layer 2's whole point (a snapshot *cheaper* than a deep clone) while staying a plain trait the block dispatches on; B can't beat layer 1, and C is layer 3 wearing a trait. A `derive Rollback` would emit the field-wise full-clone impl (snapshot = `Self`), i.e. exactly layer 1 but now overridable.

**Owner Q 1:** Should `derive Rollback` exist at all, or is the whole point that you only reach for `Rollback` when the default clone is too expensive (so it's impl-only)? (If derive == layer 1, derive may be redundant.)

**Owner Q 2:** Under Option A, when restore runs (transaction guard Drop, no `?` allowed), what happens if `restore` itself fails? Proposed: `restore` must be total (no `?`); a fallible restore is a design smell the checker rejects.

---

**Still deferred (not blocking; expand to a card when needed):**
- **D-SERDE-ACCESS — dynamic-tree accessor API.** How a user reads an untyped
  `Json`/agnostic `DataTree` by hand: pattern-match (shipped today) vs a fluent accessor
  (`tree.field("x").int()?`, `.text()`, `.bool()`, indexing). Only matters for the
  hand-impl / dynamic path (D-SERDE2), not the typed derive. Recommend: keep
  pattern-match as the floor; add minimal fluent accessors if hand-impl ergonomics demand it.

## Deferred ballots — promote when reached

The items below are not ready for owner decision. Each has a real user story
and a clear reason to wait. Promote a stub to a full card when its
prerequisite is ratified or its milestone is reached.

---

**D-PUBLISH1 — `jet publish` command shape + semver/resolver policy (board card c96).**
*User story:* Saoirse cuts a release of her Jet library and Amara pins a semver range to it.
*Decision (when promoted):* the `jet publish` command surface, version-immutability /
re-publish-refusal policy, and the resolver default (highest-compatible vs exact pins +
explicit update; lockfile default). *Why deferred:* rides **c50** (build-from-source) and
**c56** (registry upload) infra, both unverified/soft-blocked on dep approvals. Promote to a
full card with worked `jet publish` shell examples once M12.2 infra is verified.
Rec direction: `jet publish` infers version from `pkg.jet`, refuses re-publish + a dirty
tree, resolver defaults to highest-compatible with a committed lockfile. From the 2026-06-20
persona run (Saoirse, Amara).

---

**D-JITDEP1 — DECIDED 2026-06-24: approve Cranelift** (runtime-side JIT tier-1, I6 holds).
Recorded in `syntax-decisions.md`. Active work = board card for the Cranelift backend over
the `JitBackend` seam; the own-bytecode-VM and own-native-JIT progression are frozen cards.

---

**D-QUAL4 — Plain marker-tag type-position spelling (prefix vs postfix).**
*User story:* A web dev marks a value `#Tainted` at its source and needs to write
the *type* of a tainted string in a function signature — `flagged: #Tainted String`
vs `String #Tainted`. Same question for `#SingleUse`, `#NoCopy`, and the typestate
markers — the plain (non-parameterized) value-tags that attach to an existing type
rather than minting a new one (so D-QUAL3's "mint a type" Option C doesn't apply).
*Decision (when promoted):* prefix `#Tag Type` (matches every other Jet `#Marker`:
`#Test fn`, `#Numeric distinct`) vs postfix `Type #Tag`. Rec direction: **prefix**, for
one consistent marker idiom. *Why deferred:* no ready consumer — units (c68) ride D-QUAL3
and mint types; the first plain value-tag consumer is taint (D-TAINT1, gated on D-EFF1)
or single-use (D-LIN1, c71). Promote to a full card when c71 or the taint work starts.
Split from D-QUAL3 on 2026-06-24 (a single card can't pick both axes).

---

**D-PROP1 — Effect prohibitions: implicit propagation of `#(no_…)`.**
*User story:* A security engineer wants to know, by reading the root call
site, that a call graph never touches the network — without auditing every
callee. He writes `#(no_net)` on a function and the compiler traces every
reachable call for a net effect, naming the violating path.
*Why deferred:* Rides **D-EFF1** (the effect-propagation engine itself) plus
D-QUAL1's surface (`#(…)`); prohibition is the inverse-lattice follow-on once
positive effects propagate. Sequencing: D-EFF1 → D-PROP1. Board items #24/#4.

---

**D-ROLE1 — Time-varying roles: typestate + time.**
*User story:* A hotel booking system dev wants to express that a `Reservation`
is `#pending` before payment and `#confirmed` after — and that calling
`check_in` on a `#pending` reservation is a compile error.
*Why deferred:* Requires the typestate machinery from **D-STATE1** (gated on
D-QUAL2) to be ratified first; "time-varying" adds a temporal ordering
constraint on top of static typestate, a separate design question. Board item #13.

---

**D-REFINE1 — Refinement types.**
*User story:* A numeric processing library author wants `PositiveInt` to be a
type the compiler can prove is always > 0, so she doesn't pepper every
function with `require(n > 0)`.
*Why deferred:* Refinement types require a proof/SMT layer that is not in the
roadmap for v1; the simplicity ratchet (I8) requires a concrete milestone slot
and owner sign-off before any work begins. Board item #19.

---

**D-BUDGET1 — Budgets as types.**
*User story:* A systems developer writing a real-time renderer wants to express
that `render_frame` has a 16ms CPU budget and have the compiler warn if a
called function is known to exceed it.
*Why deferred:* Requires comptime cost-bound inference, which is not in the
v1 roadmap; no prior-art consensus on how to make it ergonomic without macros
(I8 / no macros). Board item #22.

---

**D-IFC1 — Information-flow and compliance tracking.**
*User story:* A fintech dev wants to annotate a value as `#pii` (personally
identifiable information) and have the compiler refuse to let it flow into a
logging call or a non-encrypted storage write without an explicit sanitize
step — enforced at compile time, not by code review.
*Why deferred:* This is **D-TAINT1 Option B** (full information-flow control —
security-label lattice, principals, `declassify`), which the **owner explicitly
deferred to post-Epoch-3 on 2026-06-21** when ratifying D-TAINT1 Option A
(`#tainted` + sanitizers). Captured here so it is not lost. Generalizes D-TAINT1
and requires the full effect/tag propagation model from D-EFF1 and D-QUAL1 to be
ratified first; the compliance dimension (what counts as a legal sink) is a policy
question that also interacts with the manifest capability model (D-QUAL1 Option A,
manifest surface). Board items #30/#33.

---

**D-REPLAY1 — Opt-in record and replay.**
*User story:* A game developer wants to record a session's inputs, replay
them deterministically to reproduce a bug, and have the compiler ensure no
hidden state (system clock, random, I/O) is read during replay without being
mocked.
*Why deferred:* Requires the effect system (D-EFF1) to tag non-deterministic
effects and a runtime record/replay harness; neither is in the v1 roadmap.
Board item #7.

---

**D-REVERSE1 — Opt-in reversible computation and solver integration.**
*User story:* A constraint-based UI layout author wants to write the forward
constraint (`width = parent.width - padding * 2`) and have Jet automatically
solve for `padding` given a target `width` — without writing the inverse by
hand.
*Why deferred:* Requires a reversibility annotation on functions and a
solver/SMT backend; no prior-art consensus on making this ergonomic without
macros or dependent types. Board item #36.

---

**D-PROTO1 — Protocol and session type generation.**
*User story:* A network protocol implementer wants to declare a
request/response handshake sequence as a type and have the compiler generate
both the client and server stubs, rejecting code that sends messages out of
order.
*Why deferred:* Session types require linear types (used exactly once, in
order) and typestate; **D-LIN1** (linear tag) and **D-STATE1** (typestate),
both gated on D-QUAL2, are prerequisites, and the code-generation surface for
protocol stubs is a separate design. Board item #9.

---

**D-VERIFY1 — Formal verification and proof integration.**
*User story:* A cryptography library author wants to attach a machine-checked
proof that her `constant_time_eq` function runs in time independent of its
inputs, and have the Jet toolchain refuse to ship the library if the proof
doesn't hold.
*Why deferred:* Requires a proof-carrying-code or SMT integration layer that
is explicitly post-v1; the simplicity ratchet (I8) bars this without a
concrete roadmap slot and owner sign-off. Board items #15/#17.

---

## B6 `defer` — already decided, no ballot

`defer` is solved; nothing to vote on. **D-DEFER1 (ratified + implemented 2026-06-20)** shipped `core.scope.guard(() => {…})` — a stdlib value whose `Drop` runs the stored lambda LIFO on every exit path including `?`. `defer`-as-primary stays rejected (S63); the `defer` keyword stays declined (D-SUGAR5).

```jet
use core.scope

fn copy_file(src: String, dst: String) -> () ? Error {
    f :: core.fs.open(src)?
    g1 :: scope.guard(() => { core.fs.close(f) })   // replaces `defer close(f)`
    g :: core.fs.create(dst)?
    g2 :: scope.guard(() => { core.fs.close(g) })   // fires before g1, even on early return
    core.fs.copy(f, g)?
}
```

**Reopen (owner-only):** you could later add `defer expr` as sugar over `scope.guard` (same Drop-backed lowering, zero runtime cost). For: it's the spelling Jai/Go/Swift/Odin/Zig converge on. Against: D-SUGAR5 declined it; it adds a second cleanup spelling and reintroduces Go's leak-by-omission class. No agent reopens this without your instruction.

---

## Coverage — D-COV1 (deferred, no ballot needed)

The epoch-3 plan scopes coverage as "tooling only — no new syntax; couples to the
test runner in `Source/main.rs` (`run_test`)." There is no user-facing surface
decision: `jet test --coverage` is the spelled-out verb and the output format (LCOV
/ HTML / stdout summary) is an implementation choice, not a syntax choice.

**Prior art:**
- **Rust tarpaulin** — `cargo tarpaulin --out Html`; produces HTML + lcov. No new
  Rust syntax. Jet takeaway: a `--coverage` flag on `jet test` is the right shape.
- **llvm-cov / cargo llvm-cov** — output: `--json`, `--lcov`, `--html`, `--text`.
  Jet takeaway: multiple formats are useful but can be deferred to a `--format`
  flag.
- **Python coverage.py** — `coverage run`; then `coverage report` / `coverage html`.
  Two-step. Jet takeaway: a single `jet test --coverage` that prints a summary to
  stdout (and optionally writes a report) is simpler than a two-step model.

**Deferred note:** if coverage ever needs a source annotation (e.g. `// @no_cover`
to exclude a line from the report), that is a syntax decision requiring a ballot.
Until then, coverage is tooling-only and can land without owner ratification. The
implementation milestone (exit criterion: `jet test --coverage` reports per-line /
per-function coverage) can proceed independently of D-TEST1 and D-TEST4.
