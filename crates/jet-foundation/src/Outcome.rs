// D-FAIL-CARRIER1=A / D-FAIL-MODEL1=A (ratified 2026-08-06) — the one outcome
// carrier under `T?` and `T ? E`.
//
// An outcome has three independent facts:
//
//   * payload — a value, part of one, or none;
//   * verdict — clean, succeeded with notes, or failed;
//   * reports — the failure report, its cause, and the notes it collected.
//
// `JetOutcome<T, E>` holds the payload on the value side and the report on the
// stop side. The two ratified surface spellings are two views of this one
// carrier, and nothing converts between them because there is nothing to
// convert:
//
//   * `T?`     is `JetOutcome<T, JetAbsent>` — absence is clean, so the report
//              is `JetAbsent`, which carries nothing.
//   * `T ? E`  is `JetOutcome<T, E>` — the report matters, so `E` is the report.
//
// Happy-path erasure: `JetAbsent` is zero-sized, so `JetOutcome<T, JetAbsent>`
// has the same layout, the same niche and the same two branches as a bare
// payload. A verdict nobody reads costs no allocation and no branch.

// it. An error type that opts into neither pays for neither.
